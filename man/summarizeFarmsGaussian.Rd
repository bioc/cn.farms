\arguments{\item{probes}{A matrix with numeric values.}
\item{weight}{Hyperparameter value in the range of [0,1] which determines 
the influence of the prior.}
\item{mu}{Hyperparameter value which allows to quantify different aspects of
potential prior knowledge. Values near zero assumes that most genes do not
contain a signal, and introduces a bias for loading matrix elements near 
zero. Default value is 0.}
\item{cyc}{Number of cycles for the EM algorithm.}
\item{tol}{States the termination tolerance. Default is 0.00001.}
\item{weightType}{Flag, that is used to summarize the loading matrix. 
The default value is set to mean.}
\item{init}{Parameter for estimation.}
\item{correction}{Value that indicates whether the covariance matrix should 
be corrected for negative eigenvalues which might emerge from the 
non-negative correlation constraints or not. 
Default = O  (means that no correction is done), 
1 (minimal noise (0.0001) is added to the diagonal elements of the 
covariance matrix to force positive definiteness), 
2 (Maximum Likelihood solution to compute the nearest positive definite 
matrix under the given non-negative correlation constraints of the covariance
matrix)}
\item{minNoise}{States the minimal noise. Default is 0.35.}
