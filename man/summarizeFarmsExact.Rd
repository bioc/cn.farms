\description{Summarization Laplacian approach with exact computation}
\details{This function implements an exact Laplace FARMS algorithm. Users should be 
aware, that a change of weight in comparison to the default parameter
might also entail a need to change of eps1 and eps2. Unexperienced users 
should not change weightZ, since a change in weightZ is also connected to 
weight, eps1 and eps2.}
\value{A list including:
the found parameters: lambda0, lambda1, Psi

the estimated factors: z (expectation), maxZ (maximum)

p: log-likelihood of the data given the found lambda0, lambda1, 
Psi (not the posterior likelihood that is optimized)

varzx: variances of the hidden variables given the data

KL: Kullback Leibler divergences between between posterior and prior 
distribution of the hidden variables

IC: Information Content considering the hidden variables and data

ICtransform: transformed Information Content

Case: Case for computation of a sample point (non-exception, special exception)

L1median: Median of the lambda vector components

intensity: back-computed summarized probeset values with mean correction

L_z: back-computed summarized probeset values without mean correction

rawCN: transformed values of L_z

SNR: some additional signal to noise ratio value}

\arguments{\item{probes}{A matrix with numeric values.}
\item{mu}{Hyperparameter value which allows to quantify different aspects of
potential prior knowledge. Values near zero assumes that most positions do 
not contain a signal, and introduces a bias for loading matrix elements near 
zero. Default value is 0.}
\item{weight}{Hyperparameter value which determines the influence of the 
Gaussian prior of the loadings}
\item{weightZ}{Hyperparameter value which determines how strong the Laplace 
prior of the factor should be at 0.}
\item{eps1}{Epsilon parameter that determines at which values the algorithm 
should do an exception handling for low values of the loadings}
\item{eps2}{Epsilon parameter that determines at which values the algorithm 
should do an exception handling for low values of the data point likelihood 
or posterior functions, that tend to be Gaussian}
\item{cyc}{Number of cycles. If the length is two, it is assumed, that a 
minimum and a maximum number of cycles is given. If the length is one, the 
value is interpreted as the exact number of cycles to be executed 
(minimum == maximum).}
\item{tol}{States the termination tolerance if cyc[1]!=cyc[2]. 
Default is 0.00001.}
\item{weightType}{Flag, that is used to summarize the loading matrix.}
\item{centering}{States how the data is centered. Default is median.}
\item{...}{Further parameters for expert users.}
